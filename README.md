# SEC-8K-Automation
## **Overview**
This project automates the process of fetching SEC-8K filings related to cybersecurity incidents, providing an efficient and timely alerting mechanism. By leveraging web scraping and email notifications, it simplifies the tracking of material cybersecurity events reported by U.S. public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Whenever a company undergoes a cybersecurity breach or incident and files an SEC-8K report (under Items 1.05 or 8.01), this project automates the retrieval process, ensuring that stakeholders are promptly notified and equipped with the official filing documents.
